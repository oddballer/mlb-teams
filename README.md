# MLB Teams List

This project is a website that renders all MLB teams that particiapted in the 2021 season, and allows the user to inspect any given team's roster.

All team data is pulled from the MLB Data API: https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs

All team images are stored locally within the project folder.

Thanks for checking it out!

Next steps I would take if this first iteration was accepted:

* Access to and implementation of team logo/player photo API

* Individual player stat pages

* Further tuning of responsive styling
